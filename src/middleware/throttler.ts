 * @param {number} options.delayAfter how many requests can be made in the windowMs time period. more if its something that gets hit often, less if its something that gets hit less often
 * @param {Function} options.delayMs - how long to delay the response, increases with each request and caps at maxDelayMs
 * @param {number} options.maxDelayMs - the maximum delay to apply, no request will be delayed longer than this
